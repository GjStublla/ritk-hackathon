                    <p>
                        We’re constantly bombarded with messages about what makes for a good life. Advertisers tell us
                        it
                        comes from owning and consuming their products. The media associate it with wealth, beauty or
                        fame.
                        And politicians claim that nothing matters more than growing the economy. But do any of these
                        things
                        really bring lasting happiness?

                        For thousands of years, people have looked to philosophy, religion and grandmotherly wisdom for
                        answers to such questions. But in recent decades this ancient wisdom has been tested by
                        scientific
                        research.

                        Scientists have found that although our genes and circumstances matter, a huge proportion of the
                        variations in happiness between us come from our choices and activities. So although we may not
                        be
                        able to change our inherited characteristics or the circumstances in which we find ourselves, we
                        still have the power to change how happy we are – by the way we approach our lives.

                    <h2>1. Do things for others</h2>
                    <p>Caring about others is fundamental to our happiness. Helping other people is not only good for
                        them; it’s good for us too. It makes us happier and can help to improve our health. Giving also
                        creates stronger connections between people and helps to build a happier society for everyone.
                        It’s not all about money - we can also give our time, ideas and energy. So if you want to feel
                        good, do good.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Do three extra acts of kindness today. Offer to help, give away your change, pay a
                            compliment, or make someone smile.</li>
                        <li>Reach out to help someone who’s struggling. Give them a call or offer your support. Let them
                            know you care.</li>

                    <h2>2. Connect with people</h2>
                    <p>Our relationships with other people are the most important thing for our happiness. People with
                        strong relationships are happier, healthier and live longer. Our close relationships with family
                        and friends provide love, meaning, support and increase our feelings of self-worth. Our broader
                        social networks bring a sense of belonging. So it’s vital that we take action to strengthen our
                        relationships and make new connections.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Make more time for the people who matter. Chat with a loved one or friend, call your parents
                            or play with the kids.</li>
                        <li>Make three extra connections today. Stop to chat in the shop, wave at a neighbour, learn the
                            name of someone new.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>3. Take care of your body</h2>
                    <p>Our body and mind are connected. Being active makes us happier as well as healthier. It instantly
                        improves our mood and can even lift us out of depression. We don’t all have to run marathons -
                        there are simple things we can do to be more active each day. We can also boost our wellbeing by
                        spending time outdoors, eating healthily, unplugging from technology and getting enough sleep.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Be more active today. Get off the bus a stop early, take the stairs, turn off the TV, go for
                            a walk – anything that gets you moving.</li>
                        <li>Eat nutritious food, drink more water, catch up on sleep. Notice which healthy actions lift
                            your mood and do more of them.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Notice the world around you</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever felt there must be more to life? Good news – there is. And it’s right here in front
                        of us. We just need to stop and take notice. Learning to be more mindful and aware does wonders
                        for our wellbeing, whether it’s on our walk to work, in the way we eat or in our relationships.
                        It helps us get in tune with our feelings and stops us dwelling on the past or worrying about
                        the future.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Give yourself a bit of head space. At least once a day, stop and take five minutes to just
                            breathe and be in the moment.</li>
                        <li>Notice and appreciate good things around you every day, big or small. Trees, birdsong, the
                            smell of coffee, laughter perhaps?</li>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>5. Keep learning</h2>
                    <p>Learning affects our wellbeing in lots of positive ways. It exposes us to new ideas and helps us
                        stay curious and engaged. It also gives us a sense of accomplishment and helps boost our
                        self-confidence and resilience. There are many ways to learn new things throughout our lives,
                        not just through formal qualifications. We can share a skill with friends, join a club, learn to
                        sing, play a new sport and so much more.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Do something for the first time today. Sample sushi, try a new route, read a different
                            newspaper or visit a local place of interest.</li>
                        <li>Learn a new skill, however small. A first aid technique or a new feature on your phone,
                            perhaps. Cook a new meal or use a new word.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>6. Have goals to look forward to</h2>
                    <p>Feeling good about the future is really important for our happiness. We all need goals to
                        motivate us and these have to be challenging enough to excite us, but also achievable. If we try
                        to attempt the impossible, this creates unnecessary stress. Choosing meaningful but realistic
                        goals gives our lives direction and brings a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when we
                        achieve them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Take the first step. Think of a goal you’re aiming for and do one thing to get started. Make
                            a call, fill in that form, tell others.</li>
                        <li>Share your dreams. Tell three people about an aspiration that is really important to you
                            this year and listen to theirs too.</li>
                    </ul>

                <!-- Step 7: Find ways to bounce back -->
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>7. Find ways to bounce back</h2>
                    <p>All of us have times of stress, loss, failure or trauma in our lives. How we respond to these
                        events has a big impact on our wellbeing. We often cannot choose what happens to us, but we can
                        choose how we react to what happens. In practice it’s not always easy, but one of the most
                        exciting findings from recent research is that resilience, like many other life skills, can be
                        learned.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Ask for help today. Confide in a friend, talk to an expert, reach out to a colleague, ask a
                            neighbour to lend a hand.</li>
                        <li>When something is troubling you, do something you really enjoy. Shift your mood and bring a
                            new perspective on the problem.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>8. Take a positive approach</h2>
                    <p>Positive emotions – like joy, gratitude, contentment, inspiration and pride – don’t just feel
                        good when we experience them. They also help us perform better, broaden our perception, increase
                        our resilience and improve our physical health. So although we need to be realistic about life’s
                        ups and downs, it helps to focus on the good aspects of any situation – the glass half full
                        rather than the glass half empty.</p>

                        <h3>Action ideas</h3>
                        <li>Do something that you know will make you feel good. Listen to music, watch something funny,
                            get outside or call an old friend.</li>
                        <li>Try to smile and say something positive or constructive every time you walk into a room.
                            Notice the reaction you get.</li>

                    <p>Nobody’s perfect. But so often we compare a negative view of ourselves with an unrealistic view
                        of other people. Dwelling on our flaws – what we’re not rather than what we’ve got – makes it
                        much harder to be happy. Learning to accept ourselves, warts and all, and being kinder to
                        ourselves when things go wrong increases our enjoyment of life, our resilience and our
                        wellbeing. It also helps us accept others as they are.

                        <li>Look for positives about the things that frustrate you – what could be seen as a ‘weakness’,

                    <h2>10. Give thanks</h2>
                    <p>Being grateful helps us appreciate the positive things in our lives. People who regularly express
                        gratitude feel happier, healthier and more fulfilled. In fact, the more grateful we are, the
                        better we feel. And the more we focus on what’s good in our lives, the more good things we tend
                        to notice. Gratitude helps shift our mindset from what we don’t have to what we do.</p>
